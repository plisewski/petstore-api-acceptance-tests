# Petstore.Api.Tests.Acceptance

This repository contains acceptance tests for the Petstore API, documented at https://petstore.swagger.io/. 
The tests are implemented using SpecFlow and RestSharp to interact with the API endpoints, ensuring they meet the expected functionalities.

### Example Test Scenarios
- **Scenario 1: Create New Pet** - This test verifies that a new pet can be added to the store via the POST endpoint.
- **Scenario 2: Delete Pet** - This test checks the functionality of the DELETE endpoint to ensure a pet can be successfully removed from the store.

### Setup and Running Tests
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have .NET Core SDK installed.
3. Navigate to the root directory of the project and run `dotnet test` to execute the tests.
